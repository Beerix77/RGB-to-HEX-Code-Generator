ENTER 3 values ie RGB to generate equivalent HEX value

Notes:
Take the first number, 220, and divide by 16. 220 / 16 = 13.75, which means that the first digit of the 6-digit hex color code is 13, or D. Take the remainder of the first digit, 0.75, and multiply by 16. 0.75 (16) = 12, which means that the second digit of the 6-digit hex color code is 12, or C.

therefore 220 = dc

0-9
10 = a
11 = b
12 = c
13 = d
14 = e
15 = f
